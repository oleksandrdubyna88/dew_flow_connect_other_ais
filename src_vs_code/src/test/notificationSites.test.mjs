/**
 * The published count of places this extension speaks to a person cannot drift.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this test exists, precisely.</b> The notifications plan promises that every message is
 * written down, and quotes a number in three documents. Its first draft published 109 call sites, a
 * class table summing to 113, and "95 events" — which is neither 109 − 16 nor 113 − 16 but the sum
 * of the table's first four rows. Every test was green, because no test knew what the number was.
 * The plan round found it by hand; this makes finding it by hand unnecessary.</p>
 *
 * <p>It runs BEFORE the compile, beside `prepareGate` and `claudeAdapter`, because it needs no
 * build: the script and this test are both ESM and read the source tree directly.</p>
